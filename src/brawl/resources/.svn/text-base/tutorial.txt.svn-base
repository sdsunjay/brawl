Introduction - BRAWL is a real time card game about quick reflexes and quick
thinking, played with different card decks. Each of the six decks, each
representing a different character, contains a unique combination of strengths,
flaws, and tricks. Because BRAWL is played in real time, it's got all the
action and flavor of a real fight!

Game Modes - There are two game modes in BRAWL. In the first, Training Mode,
players take turns playing games. This game mode is great for learning how all
 the cards work, or bringing a new player up to speed.

Tournament Mode, the second mode, is more like a real brawl, because it happens
in real time. Both players play the game at their own pace, not taking turns.
This can get pretty fast!

Object of the Game - To win a game of BRAWL, a player has to win more Bases than
your opponent does, through strategic play of all the cards. When the game is
over, you will count the number of hit cards on both ends of each Base. Whoever
has more hits on their side of the Base wins that Base, and whoever wins more
bases wins the game. if a Base has an equal number of hits from both players,
then the Base is won by whoever played it. If both players win an equal number
of bases, it's a draw.

How to Play - After selecting "New Game" from the Main Menu, you'll choose
the number of human players in the game - one or two. After this, you'll then
select which game mode to play - Training or Tournament. If you select
Tournament Mode, you'll get a chance to select how fast the computer plays their
cards. You'll then select the character you want to play as, and, if you're
playing the computer, the character it will play as. If you had selected two
player mode earlier, both humans select their characters simultaneously.

The Cards - There are many types of cards you can play in BRAWL. Following is
a description of all cards you'll see.

HIT (RH, BH, GH) - The most common card you'll see, the HIT card is the main way
to accumulate hits on a Base. They come in three colors: red, blue, and green.
You can play a HIT on either end of a base, or on another HIT of HIT-2 of the
same color. You can also play a HIT on a PRESS, as long as the color of the HIT
you're playing matches the color of the HIT(s) underneath it.

HIT2 (RH2, BH2, GH2) - The HIT-2 card is similar to the HIT card, but with a few
differences. It can only be played on a HIT or HIT-2 of the same color, but
not on a base or a press! As its name implies, this card counts as two hits.

BLOCK (RB, BB, GB) - BLOCKs come in the same colors as  HIT cards, however,
they can only be played on a HIT or HIT-2 of the same color. This card prevents
more hits from being played on a string of HITs, as you can't play a HIT on a
BLOCK.

PRESS (P) - The PRESS card is an anti-block card. It can only be played over a
BLOCK to allow the player to continue to string hits together. The HITs played
on a PRESS from that point on must match the color of the HITS previously.
A BLOCK can't be played directly on a PRESS.

CLEAR (C) - The CLEAR card removes a BASE, and all cards played on it, from the
game permanently. However, if there is only one base in play, it can't
be cleared from play. Also, if there are three bases in play, the middle base
cannot be cleared.

BASE (B) - A BASE card is automatically played at the start of the game, one
for each player. Once drawn, a BASE can be played to either side of existing
bases to allow new hits to be played. However, there can never be more than
three bases on the gameboard at once.

FREEZE (F) - A FREEZE card can be played on a base to "freeze" it, preventing
it from being affected by any other cards, including CLEARs. Each character has
three freezes, which will always be the last three cards in their deck.
Once every BASE in play is frozen, the game is over.

Tips and Strategies
* Practice. Learn each deck's strengths and weaknesses. Some decks play slowly,
others play very quickly. Many of a deck's tricks will only become apparent
after several games.
* If you are in a winning position, you can speed up the game by playing
quickly! Instead of playing cards on a BASE in play, discard them as quickly as
possible instead, so as to get to your FREEZE cards and end the game then.
* One thing to keep in mind is it is legal to play cards on both sides of a
BASE in play. This may seem strange, but it can be a good move. For example, if
you know a character is weak in a certain color of HITs, it might be wise to
immediately play that color on a BASE without hits, so they can't string
together HITs.
